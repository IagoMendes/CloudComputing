# CloudComputing

This repository was created during Cloud Computing study @ Insper (www.insper.edu.br). It contains some of the APS (Practical Supervisionised Activities) and the main individual project of this module.

## APS 1: REST service using FastAPI

In this activity, we were instructed to create a RESTful webserver with 6 endpoints:
- /task/ - *GET*: lists all tasks;
- /task/ - *POST*: adds a new tasks;
- /task/<id> - *GET*: lists task with certain id;
- /task/<id> - *PUT*: updates task with certain id;
- /task/<id> - *DELETE*: deletes task with certain id;
- /healthcheck/: status 200 without text;
  
How to use:
```bash
 uvicorn main:app --reload
```
All tests were made with Postman.

## Just so you know: 
  All folders named as APS# were used to test something (as described above), they have logical mistakes that weren't fixed because this wasn't the main purpose of the activity.
